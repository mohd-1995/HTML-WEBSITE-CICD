# Portfolio Website Documentation

## Introduction

This document serves as a reflection and guide on how I built my portfolio website. Hosted on AWS EC2, the site is a testament to my journey in web development and cloud technologies. Utilising tools like AWS, Docker, Git, Terraform, HTML/CSS, and GitHub Actions, I've created a platform that not only displays my skills but also embodies my learning curve in these technologies.

## Dockerisation

### How I Dockerised This:

#### Creating a Dockerfile

Starting with the Dockerfile, I carefully scripted commands to set up the environment. This file became the cornerstone of my Docker setup, ensuring that every component my website needed was accounted for and correctly configured.

#### Building the Image

I then proceeded to build the Docker image from my Dockerfile. This process was like putting theory into practice, turning my written instructions into a tangible, functional environment where my website could thrive.

#### Benefits of Docker

Embracing Docker was a strategic move. It offered me consistency across different environments, eliminating the "it works on my machine" problem. It also meant that my project's dependencies were neatly structured, making the setup process smoother for any other environments.

## GitHub Actions

### CI/CD Pipeline Implementation:

#### Continuous Integration (CI)

Implementing CI with GitHub Actions was a game-changer. It automated the integration of my code changes. Each time I pushed new code, it automatically ran tests and built the latest version, ensuring quality and functionality.

#### Continuous Deployment (CD)

The next step was setting up Continuous Deployment. This meant that successful changes were not just tested but also automatically deployed to my AWS environment, keeping my live website always updated with the latest changes.

#### Setting Up the Pipeline

Configuring the GitHub Actions workflow required thoughtful planning. I set up triggers so that any push or pull request to the main branch would initiate the CI/CD process. This setup ensured a seamless and automated flow from code commit to deployment.
